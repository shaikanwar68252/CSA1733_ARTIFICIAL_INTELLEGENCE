% Define the sum predicate
sum_to_n(0, 0).  % Base case: The sum of integers from 1 to 0 is 0
sum_to_n(N, Sum) :-
    N > 0,       % Ensure N is positive
    N1 is N - 1, % Decrement N
    sum_to_n(N1, Sum1), % Recursive call
    Sum is N + Sum1.    % Sum is N plus the sum of integers from 1 to N-1
